# Adding OAuth to a Node.js CRUD app
This project showcases how to add OAuth to a Node.js CRUD application using. The application contains a REST API built in [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and utilizing [Express](https://expressjs.com/). Data will be saved and retrieved from a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) database. The frontend is a [React](https://react.dev) application that uses [React Routes](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for navigation.

The project uses the [ngrok JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-javascript) to establish ingress, set a static domain, and integrate with Google OAuth.
